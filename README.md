# Module 11
## Javascript
### Completed Module 11 challenge 'app.js' stored in the 'static/js' directory

#### Challenge Summary
Included five different filters in the table.
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

Added different filters for variation. Kept the code clear and neat in order for other developers to have better readability. In further action, I would recommend develope in more filters for even more variation. For example, it would be much more convenient for users to have filters such as duration of the sightings or any comment when it comes to relationship among different events. Also, there are possibilities to make the user interface more clear and well organized so it can attract more users with different knowledge. There could be drag & drop, changing colors of the letters or background, or possibly sorting by orders.
